# Grubdash 
The grubdash project hones backend skills in setting up an API and building out specific routes allowing 
support to front-end developers so a demo of initial design ideas can be produced.

This project tests the ability to build API's with complex validation.

Project objectives:
* Run tests from the command line.
* Use common middleware packages.
* Receive requests through routes.
* Access relevant information through route parameters.
* Build an API following RESTful design principles.
* Write custom middleware functions.
